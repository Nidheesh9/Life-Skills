## Question 1: What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can happen in many ways, such as:

- Touching someone without consent, like unwanted pats, brushing against them, or forced hugs.
- Making comments about someone’s body, looks, or clothes instead of their work.
- Telling sexist jokes, spreading rumors, or making insulting remarks.
- Sending inappropriate messages, emails, images, or making unwanted late-night calls.
- Creating fear or discomfort by misusing authority, threatening, or pressuring others.
- Staring in an uncomfortable way, whistling, winking, or using rude hand gestures.
- Treating people unfairly at work (jobs, promotions, tasks) based on gender.

## Question 2: What would you do if you face or witness such behaviour?

If I face harassment or see it happening to someone else, I would:

- Take even small incidents seriously, as they can grow into bigger problems.
- Keep notes of what happened, including date, time, place, and people involved.
- Report the issue to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), HR, or a manager as soon as possible.
- Support the affected person and encourage them to speak up.
- Stay calm and clear, and tell the person that their behaviour is not acceptable.
- Follow company policies and trust the process to handle the issue fairly.
